# Programming_GameshowSimulation
There is a popular gameshow where there is only 1 door with a prize out of 3. 
The user picks a door, the host then reveals a door that isn't the prize and allows you to switch. 
Coworker didn't agree when I said switching doors give you a better chance of winning so I decided to simulate the results on c++
"Which_Door.cpp" is the program that asks the user how many games they want to play and then gives instruction for each player
(one player says yes and switches all the time while the other says no and keeps their initial guess)
"SimGameSHow.cpp"
simulates n-games and displays how many wins each person has vs how many games they each played (Ozzy always switches doors while Sean
sticks with his original pick)
