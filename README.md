# Programming_GameshowSimulation
There is a popular gameshow where there is only 1 door with a prize out of 3. 
The user picks a door, the host then reveals a door that isn't the prize and allows you to switch. 
Coworker didn't agree when I said switching doors give you a better chance of winning so I decided to simulate the results on c++
